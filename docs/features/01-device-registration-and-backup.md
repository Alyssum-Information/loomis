## 1. Overview

This is the entry point of the whole product: detect the recorder, recognize it,
and import its recordings **without ever losing source audio**. It owns the
data-integrity "safety spine"
([04 §8](../04-system-architecture.md#8-data-integrity-the-safety-spine)).

## 2. Device detection (FR-1.1)

A `DeviceWatcher` interface with platform adapters
([ADR-0011](../adr/0011-usb-device-detection.md)):

- **Baseline (all OS):** poll removable volumes via **psutil** every
  `backup.poll_interval_s` and diff the set → `device_connected` /
  `device_removed` events.
- **Native events (optional):** Windows WMI / `WM_DEVICECHANGE`; Linux pyudev —
  for instant, low-overhead notification.

## 3. Registration (FR-1.2 … FR-1.6)

1. On connect, look for `<volume>/.loomis/device.json`.
2. **Known device** → resolve the `devices` row by `device_id`; go to §4.
3. **Unknown device** → raise a UI prompt; user supplies name, owner/speaker
   hint, auto-delete, transcode policy, audio globs.
4. Write `device.json` to the volume **and** insert the `devices` row.
5. **Fallbacks:** hand-authored `device.json` is validated and accepted (FR-1.6);
   read-only volume → DB-only registration, identity falls back to volume serial
   / label (FR-1.5).

`device.json` schema and the `devices` table:
[05 §2](../05-data-model-and-storage.md#2-on-device-registration-file--devicejson),
[05 §4.1](../05-data-model-and-storage.md#41-devices). Multiple devices are
supported (FR-1.8); settings are editable later via the UI (FR-1.7).

## 4. Backup & ingest (FR-2.1 … FR-2.8)

The ordered, integrity-preserving import:

| # | Step | Guarantee |
|---|------|-----------|
| 1 | Enumerate audio by the device's globs (FR-2.1) | — |
| 2 | Dedupe against the **ledger** `recordings` (FR-2.2): fast pre-check on path+size+mtime, authoritative on SHA-256 | already-imported files skipped |
| 3 | Copy new file → `staging/` (FR-2.3) | original untouched |
| 4 | **Verify** copy by SHA-256 (FR-2.4) ⚠️ | mismatch → `quarantine/`, never deleted (FR-2.7) |
| 5 | Commit to `library/` + ledger row | atomic "backed up" point |
| 6 | (Optional) transcode + validate → [08](02-audio-compression.md) | |
| 7 | (Optional, FR-2.5) delete source ⚠️ | **only after** steps 4–6 succeed |
| 8 | Enqueue processing job → [04 §6](../04-system-architecture.md#6-processing-pipeline) | |

Capture timestamps are preserved as `recordings.recorded_at` (FR-2.8).

## 5. Source cleanup policy (FR-2.5)

Off by default. When on (global or per-device), deletion is strictly gated by a
verified backup — see the safety spine. Disconnect mid-copy leaves nothing
half-committed; the ledger makes reconnect resume idempotently
([02 §8](../02-user-flows.md#8-device-removed--reconnected)).

## 6. Failure handling

| Situation | Behaviour |
|-----------|-----------|
| Device removed mid-copy | partial staging file discarded; not committed; resume next connect |
| Hash mismatch | file → `quarantine/`; source never deleted; surfaced in UI |
| Read-only / full device | DB-only registration; warn; serial/label fallback |
| Duplicate re-import | `(device_id, sha256)` UNIQUE → no-op |

## 7. Open questions

- Heuristic for `recorded_at` when the device provides no reliable metadata.
- Whether to detect device-side file *moves/renames* vs treat as new (hash dedupe
  already covers content identity).
